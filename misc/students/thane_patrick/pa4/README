The link to my PA4 is: https://pthane.github.io/pa4ds4ling/

Two comments:
1). I named the repo pa4ds4ling, because I have another repo named pa4 from last year's phonology course.  I want to keep that because I sometimes refer back to those projects.
2). I was unable to publish my site under "slides."  I duplicated the slides folder under "docs" and was able to publish that.
